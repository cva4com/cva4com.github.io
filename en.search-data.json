{"/about/":{"data":{"":"Hextra is designed to be a simple, fast, and flexible theme for building modern static websites. It is especially well-suited for documentation websites but can also be used for various types of sites, such as blogs, portfolios, and more.\nHugo, like Jekyll, is a static site generator. What sets Hugo apart is that it is a single binary, making it easy to install and run on various platforms. It is also extremely fast and reliable, capable of rendering a site with thousands of pages in milliseconds.\nHextra is built with a mindset focused on having a minimal footprint. To get started, no extra dependencies like Node.js packages are required; all you need is a single YAML configuration file, along with your Markdown content. Thus, we can focus on writing quality content instead of setting up tooling.","credits#Credits":"Hextra cannot be built without the following tools and inspirations:\nHugo Tailwind CSS Heroicons Nextra Next.js "},"title":"About"},"/blog/":{"data":{"":" RSS Feed "},"title":"Blog"},"/docs/":{"data":{"":"The documentation is presented as a learning tool, allowing the end-user to understand all configuration and deployment aspects of a bare-metal based K3s cluster.","next#Next":"Dive right into the following section, to get started:"},"title":"Introduction"},"/download/":{"data":{"":"The documentation is presented as a learning tool, allowing the end-user to understand all configuration and deployment aspects of a bare-metal based K3s cluster."},"title":"Donwload"},"/posts/my-first-post/":{"data":{"welcome#Welcome!":"Welcome!This is my very first post.
