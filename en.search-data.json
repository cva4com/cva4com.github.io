While some factors are out of your control, such as the current state of the economy or personal issues, it’s a good idea to start preparing to enter the job market before you actually graduate. In this article, we discuss why your first job matters so much, list six reasons why it’s so hard to get a job after college and offer a list of tips to help.","6-reasons-why-new-graduates-struggle#6 reasons why new graduates struggle":"From local economic issues to undervalued majors, there are many reasons why graduates struggle in their job search. Common reasons why it’s hard for recent college graduates to find jobs include:\nUncertainty with major High competition Little work experience Few or no skills Little networking Lack of follow up 1. Uncertainty with major Upon graduation, some students discover they have no greater interest in their majors. Others discover a severe lack of job opportunities within their chosen field. Take some time to think about what specifically you enjoyed the most about your major or the classes you took. Research jobs that are a good fit for your specific major or look up potential career paths that don’t necessarily require a related degree.\n2. High competition With so many people searching for jobs at the same time after graduation periods in December and May, the job market for entry-level positions is naturally going to be much more competitive. Some industries experience more job competition than others and it becomes harder for individual graduates to stand out, even with excellent grades and experience.\nWhile it is enticing to savor the college scene in your senior year, the work you invest in your job search early on will pay in dividends later. Get started early and be consistent with your job seeking activity. Employers are looking for proactive college seniors. — Carolynn Bruce, SHRM-SCP\nIt can take more time than expected to find a job, so it’s best to start applying well before your grad date. And if you don’t meet all the qualifications a job posting lists, apply anyway. Most applicants don’t meet all the desired criteria\nRelated: 24 Best Jobs for College Grads With No Experience\n3. Little work experience Unfortunately, earning a college degree doesn’t automatically mean you can secure an interview for your dream job. Many job postings require some level of experience, whether it advertises an entry-level position or not. Consider applying for internships or jobs related to your desired career before you graduate, so that by the time you’ve finished school, you have some past experience you can include on your resume.\n4. Few or no skills Along with experience comes valuable skills, some of which individuals only learn while on the job. Employers often seek specific skills when fulfilling their roles and they may ignore resumes without them. You can gain skills valued by all kinds of employers by volunteering, interning or working, even if they aren’t in related jobs.\n5. Little networking Without work experience, it’s harder to find networking options, but you can definitely still network before you get your degree. Consider the networking opportunities that are available to you as a student or recent graduate such as:\nCollege job fairs Meeting up with your favorite professor or a potential mentor Virtual or in-person networking events Industry-focused groups Social media Volunteer opportunities Connections through friends or family 6. Lack of follow up Many recent graduates often underestimate the power of following up. After completing an interview process, it’s important to follow up with the person who interviewed you via email. Keep it professional and concise, thanking them for the opportunity and mentioning anything that could set you apart from other candidates.","tips-for-getting-a-job-after-college#Tips for getting a job after college":"If you’re struggling in your job search, there’s hope. Correcting a few minor mistakes often leads to a greater job outlook. Consider these tips when looking for a job after college:\nResearch Enhance your resume Build your online presence Apply to internships Network Research Before finalizing a decision on a major, prospective students should research their field of interest and see what the job outlook for their prospective job is. If you can’t change your major, consider adding a minor in another field you’re interested in, taking or seeking an internship in the industry you’d prefer to work in. Use job sites like Indeed to personalize your job search with filters to find jobs that fit what you’re looking for. While you may be tempted to take the first job you’re offered, consider first checking out company reviews from current and former employees to learn about work conditions, typical salaries and company culture and decide if an employer is right for you.\nEnhance your resume A common factor among many graduates struggling in their job search is the quality of their resumes. Even the greatest education and experience fail to stand out with a poor resume. Creative industries, in particular, prefer resumes with color and style, showing off the character of the applicant. Most industries prefer single-page resumes that list only the most important information.\nBuild your online presence In the digital age, there’s no better way for an individual to sell themselves than by building and maintaining their online presence. You can do this by simply making sure all your public profiles are cleaned up and professional profiles are detailed and up to date. You could also go even further and create your own website. Websites can host portfolios and resumes and provide a personalized, informative peek into what an individual is like. Profiles on networking sites and personal websites can answer many of the questions managers hold for interviews, putting these applicants ahead of others.\nApply to internships Most fields have some sort of internship opportunities. They act as valuable sources of education and experience during and after college. Some educational institutions host their own internships or require outside internships as part of their curriculum, but it’s always a good idea to complete at least one internship while in college, if possible. Employers look for applicants with experience, and an internship is a great way for you to get that experience before entering the workforce.\nNetwork Networking is one of the most vital components of a successful job search. As mentioned before, take advantage of networking events and other opportunities that place you in front of industry professionals. A friendly introduction is sometimes all it takes to obtain a job later on. Such events are also prime areas to exchange business cards. When jobs open, employers from these events may reach out.\nThe information on this site is provided as a courtesy and for informational purposes only.

Graduates who obtain a role that has little to do with their area of study (or doesn’t require a degree at all) are more likely to stay in either it or a related role for the next five years. Individuals find it difficult to deviate from that path once chosen, decreasing their odds of obtaining employment in their field. You don’t have to start off with your dream job, but finding a job that’s at least within your desired field is important."},"title":"Podcast Journey to Career Success"},"/blog/jerome-powell-ai-bubble-jobs-unemployment-crisis/":{"data":{"":"\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell drew a stark picture of a labor market that looks fine on the surface—4.3% unemployment, solid consumer spending—but is quietly losing momentum underneath. Once you adjust for statistical overcounting in the payroll data, he said during a press conference Wednesday following the FOMC meeting, “job creation is pretty close to zero.”\nHe connected that slowdown, at least in part, to what CEOs are now openly telling investors: AI allows them to do more with fewer people.\nHe noted “a significant number of companies” have recently announced layoffs or hiring pauses, with many of them explicitly citing AI as the reason.\n“Much of the time they’re talking about AI and what it can do,” Powell told reporters after the Fed’s rate-cut decision, warning large employers are signaling they won’t need to add headcount for years. “We’re watching that very carefully,” he added.\nThe comments come as the Fed cut interest rates by a quarter point to a range of 3.75%–4%, citing “downside risks to employment” even as inflation remains elevated. Powell said the U.S. economy is still expanding at a “moderate pace,” even as hiring slows. He described that spending as one of the “big sources of growth in the economy,” driven by companies building data centers and other equipment tied to artificial intelligence.\nPowell also pushed back on the idea that all that spending is amounting to another speculative bubble. He drew a clear line between today’s surge in capital expenditure and the dot-com era, noting “these companies actually have earnings.” Those projects, he said, aren’t especially sensitive to interest rates, though, since they reflect long-term bets on higher productivity.\nAt the same time, Powell emphasized the boom creates a policy dilemma for the Fed. AI and automation are boosting output, but they’re also allowing companies to do more with fewer workers, leaving the labor market softer, even while GDP stays positive.\n“We have upside risks to inflation, downside risks to employment,” he said. “This is a very difficult thing for a central bank, because one of those calls for rates to be lower, one calls for rates to be higher.”","a-bifurcated-market#A bifurcated market":"Recent corporate announcements illustrate Powell’s warning. Amazon announced this week it laid off 14,000 middle managers—about 4% of its white-collar workforcein an effort to “remove organizational layers.” The layoffs come amid their rampant investments into AI. Target, Paramount, and other large firms followed with their own cuts.\nAccording to a Challenger, Gray \u0026 Christmas report, U.S. employers have announced nearly 946,000 layoffs so far this year—the highest total since 2020—with more than 17,000 explicitly tied to AI and another 20,000 to automation.\n“Job creation is very low, and the job-finding rate for people who are unemployed is very low,” Powell said.\nThe phenomenon is so widespread some economists have coined a new term—the “Great Freeze”—to describe the dismal labor market conditions. With unemployment among recent college grads topping 5%—and AI threatening to automate entry-level office jobs—many Gen Z workers are turning to graduate school as a strategic timeout.\nThat awkward balance—strong investment but weak hiring— is now at the center of the Fed’s decision-making. Powell said the economy increasingly resembles a K-shape, with higher-income households and large corporations benefiting from strong stock markets and AI-fueled productivity gains, while lower-income consumers pull back under the weight of rising costs.\nHe pointed to anecdotal reports from major retailers and consumer companies describing a “bifurcated economy,” in which wealthier Americans continue to spend freely but those at the bottom are trading down to cheaper goods.“\n“Consumers at the lower end are struggling and buying less and shifting to lower-cost products,” Powell said, noting the uneven effects of growth make the Fed’s balancing act even more complicated.\n“There is no risk-free path for policy,” Powell said. “We’re navigating the tension between our employment and inflation goals as carefully as we can.”\nReference:\nJerome Powell says the AI hiring apocalypse is real: ‘Job creation is pretty close to zero’ Image: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images"},"title":"Podcast Journey to Career Success"},"/blog/one-page-resume-templates/":{"data":{"":"Everyone knows that writing a resume can be time-consuming and difficult.

Unless you have 5+ years of relevant work experience, there’s no reason for your resume to be two or three pages long. Pick an 11 or 12-pt font size for normal text and 14-16pt for section titles and headers. Pick an attention-grabbing (but professional) font. We recommend Ubuntu, Roboto, or Overpass. Use standard and legible resume sections. For example, your work experience should be called just that “Work Experience” and not “work history” or something else. Leverage bullet points to list information such as work achievements and responsibilities, academic details, etc. They help make the resume much more reader-friendly. Be consistent with resume formatting (e.g. use the same date format everywhere, instead of using 11.2018 in one place and November 2018 in another). Have good line spacing. You don’t want the information on your resume to look all cramped up. Always save your resume as a PDF file. It’s the safest choice, as it guarantees your resume layout will stay intact no matter what device opens it. Only save your resume as MS Word if the job you’re applying for specifically requires you to and never, ever, submit a JPEG or PNG of your resume. Resume Formats The first thing you want to know is that there are four main resume formats out there, namely:\nThe reverse-chronological resume format. This is the most common and practical resume format in 2024. The functional resume format is also known as the skills-based resume format. The combination resume format, or hybrid resume format, is a combination of the other two formats. The infographic resume format, An infographic resume example uses visual elements to highlight a candidate’s creative qualifications. At this point, you’re probably asking yourself how these 4 formats are different from each other.\nWell, the main difference is that they focus on different parts of an applicant’s experience by listing sections in different orders.\nSo, in a nutshell:\nThe reverse-chronological resume format focuses on your work experience, listing them from most to least recent. The functional resume format focuses on your skills that are relevant to the job. The combination resume format focuses on your experience and skills by aiming to prove that you possess the skills you list through your work achievements. The infographic resume format focuses on your creativity and presents it visually. Chronological Resume A chronological resume emphasizes your career progression by listing your experience in reverse-chronological order, starting with your most recent job listed at the top and each previous position in descending order. This is the most widely used resume format.\nThe main thing about this resume format is that it’s useful for practically every job-seeker.\nThe reverse-chronological format has a very simple structure, it’s easy to skim, and overall, it’s the most popular format around the globe.\nFor this reason alone, we typically recommend using this format to most people - even if using one of the other formats also makes sense.\nIt usually looks like this:\nHere’s what you’d include in a reverse-chronological resume:\nWhat to Include Contact Information - Your name, phone number, location, and email address. In some cases, you can include useful links such as a LinkedIn or GitHub profile. Resume Summary or Objective - A brief 2-4 sentence summary of your work experience, or your objective for applying for a given position. Professional Title - Your title. This should mirror the exact position you’re applying for. Work Experience - Your work experience in reverse-chronological order. When possible, talk about achievements over responsibilities. Skills Section - Skills relevant to the position you’re applying for. Education - Your educational history. Pro tip - if you have a B.A., feel free to skip your high school education. Optional Sections - Sections like volunteering, projects, portfolio, hobbies, etc. While they’re not a game-changer, they can help fill up some space on your resume. As we already mentioned, this resume format primarily focuses on the one part that’s relevant to most hiring managers - your work history.\nAs such, the key to making the most out of this resume format is nailing the work experience section. To do that, here’s how you should structure it:\nStart with your most recent job and go backward from there. Tailor the section to the job description. This means that you shouldn’t list every job you ever worked - only the ones that are relevant for this one. For each job that you list, include your job title, the name of the company, the location, and the time period you worked there. Below, add four to five bullet points for recent jobs and two to three bullet points for earlier jobs. Focus on your achievements instead of your responsibilities. Hiring managers already know the basic responsibilities of the jobs they’re hiring for. So, rather than your responsibilities, they want to learn about your achievements. Whenever possible, quantify your achievements. Facts and numbers are more convincing than words. Use action verbs and power words. (E.g. “created” instead of “was responsible for creating”). Example As we already mentioned, the best thing about the reverse-chronological format is that it’s a great choice whether you’re an entry-level worker or a seasoned professional.\nAny relevant experience you’ve got, the chronological experience will highlight effectively.\nFor example, here’s a digital marketer’s resume work experience section created using the reverse-chronological format:\nDigital Marketing Manager\nWonderfull Agency Inc.\n06/2017 - Present\nCreated a new format for reporting and presenting the sales, customer engagement and Google Ads reports that decreased the number of meetings by 24% in the last three quarters.

Pros \u0026 Cons Still not sure if the reverse-chronological resume format is the right choice for you? See our pros and cons below!\nℹ️ Pros\nRecruiters and HR managers prefer this format. It will definitely “beat” Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software. Provides a reader-friendly chronological history of your work experience. The most popular resume format in 2024. ⚠️ Cons\nYou need to make your work achievements stand out to catch the recruiter’s attention. Hard to fill in for a recent graduate with no work experience. Makes career gaps very obvious. If you’re a career changer, you need to explain those employment gaps on your resume. Functional Resume Changing careers or have big gaps in your employment history? The functional resume format may be for you.\nIf you have a lot of career gaps or don’t have much work experience, you’ll benefit from using a resume format that focuses on your skills — and that’s exactly what the functional resume does.\nAs we already mentioned, the functional resume format is also known as the skills-based resume format.\nAs the name suggests, the functional resume format focuses on your skills and your key strengths.\nIn a nutshell, this resume format takes the spotlight away from your work experience by highlighting what you’re good at instead.\nAs such, this resume format is perfect for recent graduates or career changers who have little-to-no experience in a particular field.\nHere’s an example of what it looks like:\nWhat to Include Contact Information Resume Summary or Objective Professional Title Skills Summary Additional Skills Work Experience Education As you can see, the main difference from the reverse-chronological format is that the focus of the functional resume is the skills summary and the resume objective that’s placed right at the top of the resume.\nHere is exactly how you should write them to impress the hiring manager:\nUse your resume objective to state your career intent and explain what makes you the ideal candidate for the job. Start off your resume objective by mentioning a skill, education, or certification relevant to the job, mention the responsibilities you could handle, and include your motivation for working that particular job. In the skills summary, include four or five skills that are most relevant to the position. Instead of just listing your skills, be descriptive. In bullet points or in plain paragraphs, give examples of how you applied these skills in practice and try to make them as quantifiable as possible. Example Let’s assume that you’re an entry-level journalist.\nSince you graduated, you’ve worked as a part-time intern at a magazine and published a dozen articles online and in print. You also run a blog that has a modest but loyal readership.\nNow, you want to apply for an actual journalism position at a recently founded newspaper. So, you’re using the functional resume format.\nHere’s why it’s the right choice:\nIt highlights your skills. In this case, you don’t have the experience to apply for the job, but you may have all the right skills. It allows you to prove your skills. There’s ample space to show exactly how you can put your skills to use for the upcoming job. Now let’s see what your resume objective and skills summary (or areas of strength) would look like in this case:\nResume ObjectiveDriven and hardworking journalism graduate looking to get hired as a reporter in The Daily Prophet. I interned at Who Magazine for six months, where I gained hands-on experience in research, fact-checking, and interviewing. Passionate blogger at Fake Blog Website, which is currently followed by over two thousand readers.\nSkills SummaryResearch \u0026 Fact checking\nAble to systematically look for information, resources, data, etc. through a variety of sources, such as books, online directories, or social media. Careful to always ensure that every claim and data that gets published is accurate and legitimate. Interviewing\nFull knowledge of journalism ethics and standards that are required to conduct successful and dignified interviews. Skilled at connecting with interviewees on a deeper level to ensure comprehensive and detailed interviews. Writing\nExcel at several types of journalistic writing, including news, feature writing, columns, and reviews. Have published over 15 articles in different newspapers and magazines since graduating. Considering that the functional resume focuses solely on a candidate’s skills, the only groups of candidates who should consider using it are:\nFreelancers with impressive portfolios Professionals in creative industries Career changers Recent graduates, and entry-level professionals Military veterans passing into civilian roles Pros \u0026 Cons So, to sum it all up:\nℹ️ Pros\nGood for highlighting specific skills. Useful if you’re switching careers since you can explain how your skills transfer to the new job. Useful if you’re a recent graduate with practical skills but not much work experience. ⚠️ Cons\nThe functional resume format is not very popular in 2024, and most recruiters and hiring managers aren’t familiar with it, so using this format carries a bit of a risk. Since the functional resume has less focus on work experience, recruiters might think you’re trying to hide something. Applicant tracking systems (ATS) have difficulties reading functional resumes. When to use You should use a functional resume in the following situations:\nYou want to explain long periods of unemployment. You’re switching to a new career and don’t have much relevant experience. You want to highlight specific professional skills rather than your experience. By focusing on your skills, the functional resume emphasises the value you offer employers and draws attention away from your work history.\nCombination Resume The combination resume format, also known as the “hybrid,” is a mixture of the functional and the reverse-chronological format.\nThe combination resume format is especially well-suited for highly-trained job seekers who want to place equal emphasis on their skills and work history.\nThis resume format gives equal attention to an applicant’s skills section and work experience. As such, you end up including both the Skill Summary and the Work Experience sections:\nContact Information Skill Summary Additional Skills Work Experience Education The focal point here is the skills summary. Placed right after the contact information section, this is where you list the skills that are required for the job and then prove that you have them through your professional experience and achievements.\nHere is exactly how you should write it:\nList the skills that are required for the position you’re applying for and that you actually possess. Add up to 4 professional achievements underneath each skill to prove that you possess it. Make your achievements as descriptive and quantifiable as possible. Example Say you’re a senior program manager with over a decade of experience in your field.\nYou can plan, execute, evaluate programs and projects across diverse industries, and inspire your team to do great work.\nRecently, someone told you about an opening for a program director in an international company. To apply, you’re putting together a hybrid resume format.\nHere’s what makes it the best choice:\nSaves space. For highly competitive positions, you want your resume to be able to cut through the noise. The hybrid format allows you to do that by bringing into focus your most relevant achievements right from the start. Combines the best parts of the other two resume formats, which is perfect for senior professionals or executives that have plenty to show for both experience and skills. For example, some of the skills required for the program director gig mentioned above may include interpersonal skills, budget management, and project management.\nHere’s what the skills summary in your hybrid resume would look like in practice:\nInterpersonal Skills\nInitiated formal and informal coaching and mentorship to 50+ team members regarding project charter development, resource planning, best practices of project management, and appropriate delivery of project outcomes. Coordinated all project inputs with several functional/technical directors, managers, and project core teams, to formulate appropriate project tools and methodologies. Budget Management\nOversaw the implementation of the enterprise’s multi-year, multi-million dollar research system software that benefited employees company-wide. Analysis of financial and statistical data reduced operational costs by 12%. Strategically supervised the project execution teams to ensure the timely and cost-effective completion of projects, saving the company $250K in project costs. Project Management\nProvided strategic direction, leadership, and project governance for a multimillion-dollar application project portfolio, which successfully supported a population of 60K+ end-users across the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Streamlined project management methodologies and communication in the IT division, which increased efficiency by 90%. Accurately report on project status throughout its life cycle to 20+ project teams, stakeholders, and sponsors, encompassing budget estimation, scheduling, and resource planning. Pros \u0026 Cons ℹ️ Pros\nAllows you to show off more of your experience and skills using less space. Useful for very senior professionals or executives who need to highlight more than just their work experience. Good for applicants who may have a noticeable employment gap but plenty of work experience nonetheless. ⚠️ Cons\nAs with the functional resume format, applicant tracking systems have difficulties reading combination resumes. If you’re a recent graduate or don’t have much work experience, this resume format is not very useful. As is the case with the functional resume, most hiring managers aren’t very familiar with this format, which might cause some confusion in the process. When to use You should use a combination resume in the following situations:\nYou’re making a career change and want to emphasize your transferable skills You have a specific, well-developed set of technical skills you want to highlight You’re a senior-level candidate with a diverse range of experience and skills Infographic Resume Want to make an infographic resume that helps you land your dream job?

Before you try making an infographic resume, it’s important to consider whether it’s the right option for you and the job you want.\nAn infographic resume is a resume that uses graphics to visually represent information, often in the form of bar charts, graphs, timelines, or statistics.\nThis style of visual resume is often used to convey a candidate’s skill in graphic design or another artistic field.\nAn infographic resume is useful for grabbing attention and highlighting your skills in a creative way. However, in some cases using an infographic resume could come across as unprofessional and negatively impact your chances of landing a job.\nThat’s why it’s important to know when exactly it’s appropriate to use an infographic resume (and when it’s not).\nWhen to use You should only use an infographic resume when you’re using it to showcase skills directly related to the job you’re applying for (such as graphic design) and you’re capable of making it look professional.

Now that we’ve covered all 4 of the common resume formats, you’re probably wondering which one’s best resume format out there.\nHere’s our verdict:\nIn 90%+ of the cases, we’d recommend going with a reverse-chronological resume format.\nIn 2024, it’s the most common and useful format:\nApplicant tracking systems can read it without any problems. All recruiters and hiring managers are familiar with this format. Whether you’re a recent graduate or a senior professional, it’s the easiest format to work with. So, even if you’re a career changer, a highly-qualified professional, or a college student, it’s risky to choose one of the other two formats over the reverse-chronological one.\nThere’s a good chance that the applicant tracking system won’t be able to read your resume and automatically discard it - after all the time you put into creating the resume!\nAt the same time, recruiters might just not be familiar with these resume formats, or think that you’re just trying to hide the fact that you’re not experienced, and disqualify you based on that.\nSo, the rule of thumb - when in doubt, go for the reverse-chronological resume.\nWritten by: Andrei Kurtuy\nSource: https://novoresume.com/career-blog/resume-formats\nReference:\nHow to Write a CV (Curriculum Vitae) in 2024 [31+ Examples] How to Write a Functional Resume [4 Free Templates Included] Combination Resume Guide [w/ Templates \u0026 Examples] Chronological Resume Template, Examples, and Format How to Write a Functional Resume (with Template and Examples) Combination Resume Template \u0026 Examples How to Make an Infographic Resume (with Examples and Templates) "},"title":"Best Resume Formats"},"/docs/":{"data":{"":"The documentation is presented as a learning tool, allowing the end-user to understand all configuration and deployment aspects of a bare-metal based K3s cluster.","next#Next":"Dive right into the following section, to get started:"},"title":"Introduction"},"/download/":{"data":{"":"The documentation is presented as a learning tool, allowing the end-user to understand all configuration and deployment aspects of a bare-metal based K3s cluster."},"title":"Donwload"},"/posts/my-first-post/":{"data":{"welcome#Welcome!":"Welcome!This is my very first post.
