I was honestly blown away by the sheer number of options – it’s perfect if you want your resume to have a distinct visual flair.\nBut be warned: you’ll need to manually input all your info. Unlike some other online resume builders, Canva doesn’t offer pre-filled text or provide advice on how to write your resume.\nAdditionally, you can’t upload your current resume for a redesign, and will have to fill in each text field individually. This makes it a more time-consuming option than other websites I tried.\nCanva’s resume builder is free to use, but many features and templates require you to sign up for a Canva Pro account, which is $120 per year.\nVerdict: With a huge library of templates, Canva is the best free resume builder online, and is a great choice for graphic designers in particular. However, if you’re short on time or aren’t sure what to include on your resume, you’re better off using a more streamlined, content-focused resume builder.\nℹ️ Pros\nMany resume template options Highly customizable ⚠️ Cons\nNeed to manually fill in each section Little resume writing guidance offered ","enhancv#EnhanCV":"\nEnhanCV offers one of the best free resume builders online.\nWhen starting EnhanCV’s resume builder process, you’re greeted by Julia, a virtual assistant and “resume expert”.
