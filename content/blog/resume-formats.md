How you format your resume matters. 

When reviewing your resume, the first thing hiring managers notice is how your resume looks, not what it contains.

And if the first thing they see is a messy, cluttered, crowded resume, chances are you won’t make a great first impression.

So, this begs the question: what are the best resume formats, and which one should YOU use?

## Resume Formats

- **The reverse-chronological resume format.** This is the most common and practical resume format in 2024.
- **The functional resume format** is also known as the skills-based resume format.
- **The combination resume format**, or hybrid resume format, is a combination of the other two formats.
- **The infographic resume format**, An infographic resume example uses visual elements to highlight a candidate’s creative qualifications.

At this point, you’re probably asking yourself how these 3 formats are different from each other. 

Well, the main difference is that they focus on different parts of an applicant’s experience by listing sections in different orders.

So, in a nutshell:
- The reverse-chronological resume format focuses on your work experience, listing them from most to least recent.
- The functional resume format focuses on your skills that are relevant to the job.
- The combination resume format focuses on your experience and skills by aiming to prove that you possess the skills you list through your work achievements.
